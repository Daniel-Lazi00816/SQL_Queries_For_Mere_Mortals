# SQL Queries For Mere Mortals

## Introduction:

John L. Viescas fourth edition of this canonical text going over the ins and outs of basic to complex SQL queries serves as the database professionals guide to thinking about how we use this language to achieve our goals. Over the next several weeks I will be reading through this book and recreating the queries while restating their purpose chapter by chapter to further solidfy my understanding of this critical language in working with data. 

## Databases:

The databases used in these examples come from the following link and going under the downloads tab.

## Chapter 1, 2 and 3: 

The first three chapters discuss the nature of relational databases and will not have any examples to work with and for that reason will not be uploaded to this repository. 

# Chapter 4 Creating a simple query:
Chapter 4 is straight forward. We learn the basics of queries and the logice which is underneath them. After that we learn how to use the DISTINCT function and the nature of the ORDER BY and GROUP BY clause. 

# Chapter 5 Getting More than Simple Columns:
Chapter 5 deals with expressions, data types, the CAST function use of literals, and the NULL value. Expressions are great when you are asking WHAT IF questions. The CAST function is best utilized to change the data type of a column in order to combine with another element of a query. For example, if you wanted to add a numeric type column say Zip Code to an address column you would need to use CAST to change the Zip Code to a CHAR data type. All values in an expression must generally be compatible in order for the operation defined within the expresion to work properly.
